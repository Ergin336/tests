#    this is an UART-LoRa device and thers is an firmware on Module
#    users can transfer or receive the data directly by UART and dont
#    need to set parameters like coderate,spread factor,etc.
#    |============================================ |
#    |   It does not suport LoRaWAN protocol !!!   |

#    This script is mainly for Raspberry Pi 3B+, 4B, and Zero series
#    Since PC/Laptop does not have GPIO to control HAT, it should be configured by
#    GUI and while setting the jumpers, 
#    Please refer to another script pc_main.py
